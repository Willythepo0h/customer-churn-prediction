# Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Portfolio Project  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository showcases a complete data analytics and machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).  

The goal is to demonstrates skills across **machine learning**, **Excel analytics**, and **Power BI dashboarding**, simulating a real-world end-to-end workflow â€” from raw data analysis to predictive modeling and interactive reporting.
